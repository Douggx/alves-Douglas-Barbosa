### Objective

- Project made with the intention of applying the concepts of react-router-dom and the use of custom hooks.

### What works
- Based on Labex [API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9133542/TzCTZkQr)
- Login page, Trip creations and Trip applications
- Admin Dashboard
- Approve or Disapprove candidates system
- Mobile responsive on Iphone 6/7/8

### Languages, frameworks and libraries used

- React, JavaScript, HTML, Styled Components, Axios, Figma and React-router-dom

### What I learned

With this project I believe I have improved in the handling of projects with larger dimensions (more pages), the use of the useForm hook was and will be of extreme help from now on
